# Romero_CSCI2270_FinalProject
A maze with different attributes that makes it difficult to escape. By creating
a binary tree, the user would be able to traverse throughout the maze,
uncover hidden passage ways with a random event happening ever so often.
Using the graph search to explore what lies ahead and behind the user,
also, the user would be able to leave bread crumbs behind or rope
as to show where they have been. This maze will be not two dimensional,
but three, maybe four as a random event for fun.
